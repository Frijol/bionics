# Terms and acronyms

* P/O: Prosthetics and orthotics
* ADL: Activities of daily living
* RGO: Reciprocating gait orthoses
* LEO: Lower extremity orthoses
* pLEO: Powered lower extremity orthoses
* SCI: Spinal cord injury
* HKAFO: hip knee ankle foot orthosis
* FES: Functional electrical stimulation - stimulating muscles to move
* McKibben muscle: pneumatic muscle
* EMG: Electromyogram (electrical impulses from muscles)
* AFO: ankle/foot orthosis
* exoskeleton: a device that enhances the physical capabilities of an able-bodied user (typically in parallel with existing limbs)
* orthosis: a device to assist a person with an impairment of the limbs (typically in parallel with the existing limb)
* prosthesis: a device which supplants a missing limb and acts in serial with existing limbs
* environmental state: terrain features and surface conditions of the environment
* CPG: central pattern generator, a network of spinal interneurons, thought to generate the basic motor patterns used in locomotion
* Efferent nerve fibers: motor neurons
* Afferent nerve fibers: sensory neurons
* reflex arcs: the nerve pathway involved in a reflex action including at its simplest a sensory nerve and a motor nerve with a synapse between
* fNIRS: functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Used to read haemodynamic activity of the brain through the scalp optically (akin to EEG)
* TMR: targeted muscle reinnervation - severed nerves are surgically reattached & used to innervate a foreign muscle, which is used for EMG readings (muscle serves as a biological amplifier) - lets you have a surgery up front & then noninvasive attachment/detachment of a prosthetic
